==================================================================================================================
1) Data vs Information
Ans: Data is raw fact and A set of organize data is called information.
==================================================================================================================



2) Database and Types of Database:
Ans: Database: System to keep data also we can
     -keep
     -Manage(modify,update,delete)
     -Retrive(fetch)

Types of Databse:
Relational Database Management System (RDBMS):
-----------------------------------------------
Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server.
Uses a tabular structure with rows and columns to store and organize data. Relationships between tables are established using keys.

NoSQL Database:
-----------------------------------------------
Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, CouchDB, Redis.
Suitable for handling unstructured or semi-structured data. NoSQL databases can be document-oriented, key-value stores, wide-column stores, or graph databases.

Graph Database:
-----------------------------------------------
Examples: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune.
Designed to store and manage data whose relationships are as important as the data itself. Suitable for applications with complex relationships, such as social networks or fraud detection.

In-Memory Database:
-----------------------------------------------
Examples: Redis, Memcached, SAP HANA.
Stores data in system memory (RAM) instead of on disk, resulting in faster data retrieval and processing.

Columnar Database:
-----------------------------------------------
Examples: Google Bigtable, Apache Cassandra.
Organizes data by columns rather than rows, which can be more efficient for certain types of queries and analytics.

Time-Series Database:
-----------------------------------------------
Examples: InfluxDB, Prometheus.
Optimized for handling time-stamped or time-series data, such as sensor data, financial market data, or logs.

Document-Oriented Database:
-----------------------------------------------
Examples: MongoDB, CouchDB.
Stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, making it suitable for handling semi-structured data.

Spatial Database:
-----------------------------------------------
Examples: PostGIS (extension for PostgreSQL), Oracle Spatial.
Geared towards storing and querying spatial or geographic data, such as maps, coordinates, and spatial relationships.

Object-Oriented Database:
-----------------------------------------------
Examples: db4o, ObjectDB.
Stores data in the form of objects, making it suitable for applications with complex data structures and relationships.

Cloud Database:
-----------------------------------------------
Examples: Amazon Aurora, Google Cloud Firestore.
Hosted on cloud platforms, offering scalability, flexibility, and ease of management.

3) Table, Record, Field,Value:
Ans:
Table: a set of data
Record: Row of a table
Field: Column name of a table
value: data stored in table


In the context of Database Management Systems (DBMS), a "value" typically refers to the actual data stored in a database. In a relational database, data is organized into tables, and each table consists of rows and columns. Each intersection of a row and a column represents a specific data point, and this data point is the "value."

Here's a brief breakdown:

Table: A collection of related data organized in rows and columns.
Row (Tuple): Represents a single record or instance of data in the table.
Column (Attribute): Represents a specific type of data, and all values in a column are of the same data type.
Value: The actual data stored at the intersection of a row and a column.
For example, consider a simple "Employees" table:

++-----------+--------------+-------------+-----+--------++
|| EmployeeID| FirstName    | LastName    | Age | Salary ||
++-----------+--------------+-------------+-----+--------++
|| 1         | John         | Doe         | 30  | 50000  ||
|| 2         | Jane         | Smith       | 25  | 60000  ||
|| 3         | Bob          | Johnson     | 35  | 75000  ||
++-----------+--------------+-------------+-----+--------++

In this table, each cell represents a value. For instance, the value in the "FirstName" column for the first row is "John," and the value in the "Salary" column for the second row is "60000."

4) DBMS,RDBMS
DBMS: 
-data
-user
-hardware(computer,ram,rom,pendrive)
-software(software - RDBMS)
-processing unit



Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS), here are some alternatives:

PostgreSQL:
-------------------------------------------
Known for its advanced features, extensibility, and support for complex queries. PostgreSQL is open-source and follows SQL standards closely.

MariaDB:
-------------------------------------------
A fork of MySQL, led by the original developers of MySQL. MariaDB is designed to be highly compatible with MySQL and offers additional features.

Microsoft SQL Server:
-------------------------------------------
Developed by Microsoft, SQL Server is a powerful RDBMS with strong integration capabilities with Microsoft's ecosystem. It's commonly used in Windows-based environments.

Oracle Database:
-------------------------------------------
Oracle Database is an enterprise-grade RDBMS with a wide range of features. It is often used in large-scale and mission-critical applications.

SQLite:
-------------------------------------------
A lightweight, serverless, and self-contained RDBMS that is suitable for embedded systems, mobile applications, and scenarios where simplicity is key.

==================================================================================================================





5) Key, Primary Key,Foreign Key,candidate key,composite key:

Key:
-----------------------------------------------
A key is a field or combination of fields in a database table that is used to identify records uniquely. Keys help establish relationships between tables and maintain data integrity.

Primary Key:
-----------------------------------------------
The primary key is a specific type of key that uniquely identifies each record in a table.
It must have unique values, and no NULL values are allowed.
There can be only one primary key in a table.
Example: In an "Employees" table, an "EmployeeID" column could be a primary key.

Foreign Key:
-----------------------------------------------
A foreign key is a field in a database table that is a primary key in another table.
It establishes a link between the data in two tables, creating a relationship.
The foreign key in one table refers to the primary key in another table.
Example: If you have a "Departments" table with a primary key "DepartmentID," and an "Employees" table with a foreign key "DepartmentID," the foreign key in the "Employees" table links to the primary key in the "Departments" table.

Candidate Key:
-----------------------------------------------
A candidate key is a field or combination of fields that can be chosen as the primary key for a table.
Like a primary key, it must have unique values and no NULL values.
In a table, there may be multiple candidate keys, and one of them is chosen to be the primary key.
Example: In an "Employees" table, both "EmployeeID" and "Email" could be candidate keys.

Composite Key:
-----------------------------------------------
A composite key is a primary key composed of two or more columns.
It is used when a single column cannot uniquely identify records, but the combination of columns can.
Example: In a "Sales" table, a composite key could be formed by combining "ProductID" and "OrderID" to uniquely identify each sales record.

6) Relation
- one to one
- one to many
- many to many

--> One-to-One (1:1) Relationship:
In a one-to-one relationship, each record in Table A is associated with exactly one record in Table B, and vice versa.
This relationship is less common and is typically used when the related information is optional or can be separated for normalization purposes.
Example: An employee table and an employee details table, where each employee has a single set of details.

CREATE TABLE Employee (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE EmployeeDetails (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Address VARCHAR(100),
    CONSTRAINT FK_EmployeeDetails FOREIGN KEY (EmployeeID) REFERENCES Employee(EmployeeID)
);

-->One-to-Many (1:N) Relationship:
In a one-to-many relationship, each record in Table A can be associated with multiple records in Table B, but each record in Table B is associated with only one record in Table A.
This is a common relationship, and it is established using a foreign key in the "many" side table.
Example: An order table and an order items table, where each order can have multiple items.

CREATE TABLE Order (
    OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CustomerID INT,
    OrderDate DATE,
    CONSTRAINT FK_Order_Customer FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customer(CustomerID)
);

CREATE TABLE OrderItem (
    OrderItemID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    OrderID INT,
    ProductID INT,
    Quantity INT,
    CONSTRAINT FK_OrderItem_Order FOREIGN KEY (OrderID) REFERENCES Order(OrderID)
);


--> Many-to-Many (M:N) Relationship:
In a many-to-many relationship, each record in Table A can be associated with multiple records in Table B, and vice versa.
This relationship requires an additional junction table to resolve the many-to-many association.
Example: A student table and a course table, where each student can enroll in multiple courses, and each course can have multiple students.

CREATE TABLE Student (
    StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE Course (
    CourseID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CourseName VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE Enrollment (
    EnrollmentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    StudentID INT,
    CourseID INT,
    CONSTRAINT FK_Enrollment_Student FOREIGN KEY (StudentID) REFERENCES Student(StudentID),
    CONSTRAINT FK_Enrollment_Course FOREIGN KEY (CourseID) REFERENCES Course(CourseID)
);
